The bookcode of the original variable can be retrieved in the zip file.

These are the main improvements on the raw data provided in the course:

* The trained and the test records have been merged in one single data frame

* The data frame has now a column specifying the subject id and the descriptive 
name of the activity (a merge/join of different data sets have been produced)

* Among the numerical features, only the ones related to a standard deviation or to a mean have been selected

Here is the list of the filtered data frame after these steps

activity
```
* `subject id` identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample.
Its range is from 1 to 30. is an id from 1 to 30
* `activity` takes the following values
```
WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
STANDING
LAYING
```
- Features are 

* The standard deviations and the means are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]
